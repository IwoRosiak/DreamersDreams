	<description>Thank you for downloading my mod! You are amazing!

To report any issue refer to mod page which I check every minute : )

&lt;size=22&gt;Notes:&lt;/size&gt;
- Doesn't require a new save
- On fresh install, currently resting pawns will not get dreams. Dreams will only be applied on rests which started when mod was installed.

&lt;size=22&gt;Features:&lt;/size&gt;
- Pawns will dream while they rest.

&lt;size=22&gt;Propose a dream!&lt;/size&gt;
Tell us about your favourite dreams (from your life :> ) and I will try to implement it into the mod :D

&lt;size=22&gt;Happy Dreaming...&lt;/size&gt;
