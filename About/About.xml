	<description>Thank you for downloading my mod! You are amazing!

To report any issues please refer to the mod page which I check every minute : )

&lt;size=22&gt;Notes:&lt;/size&gt;
- Doesn't require a new save

&lt;size=22&gt;Features:&lt;/size&gt;
- Pawns will dream while they rest.
- Pawns with the sleepwalker trait will occassionally sleepwalk, causing a bit of disturbances among the colony...
- Dreams depend on personality. For example, cannibals will have more unique dreams than a normal colonist...
- Mod settings that allow you to customise your experience.

&lt;size=22&gt;Propose a dream!&lt;/size&gt;
Tell us about your favourite dreams (from your life :> ) and I will try to implement it into the mod :D

&lt;size=22&gt;Happy Dreaming...&lt;/size&gt;
