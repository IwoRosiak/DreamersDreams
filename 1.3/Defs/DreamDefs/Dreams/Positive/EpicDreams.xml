        <description>I was walking around colony, when I realised that I'm wearing no clothes! I looked around and noticed that everyone took off their clothes as they saw me! We started to drink and dance around our home naked.</description>

        <description>I was a small animal (I think it was a raccoon?) in a random windy forest. It was pretty nice even if all I did was wander around and occasionally see other creatures, and at some point I think I befriended a groundhog. I'm not too sure on how it ended but the last thing I vaguely remember was seeing buildings over a hill. ~~okoyum</description>
