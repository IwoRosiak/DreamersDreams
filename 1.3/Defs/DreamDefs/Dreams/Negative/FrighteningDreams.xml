        <description>I had a dream in which I walked around the colony. After a few moments I realised that my head was rolling down the hill away from our home. I chased it until it stopped. After finally regaining my precious head, I looked around. Everything was burned to the ground and the only sounds were coming from strange machinery spitting out mechanoids...</description>

      <label>Dreamt about redhead with beard</label>
      <description>It started off at school, where I began to realize something was wrong. Everyone I saw looked like they could barely contain themselves from instantly becoming violent, and they had this look in their eyes like they had just spotted the best prey they had ever seen, but were held back by something. I remember thinking "No way, I'm out", and ran home as fast as I could. Some of it is blurry, but I remember coming across people that I knew, either friends or family, or people from the neighborhood, telling me to get home, that it's not safe. Finally I make it there, put the key in the front door, open it, and I am literally surrounded by all of those same people, only now they look like the ones at school, and there stands the redhead with the beard. Without saying a word she lunges at me and pierces my neck with her fangs. ~Rinzler0001</description>
