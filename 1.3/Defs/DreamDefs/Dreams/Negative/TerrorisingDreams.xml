        <description>I way lying on a huge pile of human corpses, some rotten, some fresh. I couldn't move. It was some kind of cargo section inside of a ship in the sea. From the pile crawled a rotten corpse and he grabbed my feet and bit off some toes. He crawled closer and tried to bite... well... that place... I woke up with pain in that place... ~Backrevol</description>
