  <DreamSpaceship.stages.0.label>{0_gender ? Śniłem : Śniłam} o tourist spaceship</DreamSpaceship.stages.0.label>
  <DreamSpaceship.stages.0.description>I was one of the high-ranking officers in white uniform. Me, and some others were on a cubical, tourist, 2 miles long spaceship. The command center was located in a tower in the middle of the ship, deep within instead of the outer shell of spacecraft. The weirdest thing was that the ship captain was a 3 feet tall rat in white uniform. Everyone respected him. One time, a canadian hockey player in his hockey uniform with the helmet on decided to visit our ship. We welcomed him aboard, and everyone was happy. While we were walking along side the footbal field, we saw a tank, and the rat was controlling it. Our rat captain pointed the tank's barrel towards the hockey player, and I had to run in front of the hockey player for it to cease fire and not shoot the hockey player. The tank stopped, and then started driving away. As it started moving backwards, we were cheering. I showed the hockey player inside the ship, where there was a ton of supermarket-like shops, one of them was hanging on the ropes. After that in some time I lost the hockey player, but then he came back, thanked me for my service and left. After a while we got news that the captain was killed in an explosion. I rushed to the top of the tower with the command center, and I entered a luxury apartament on the very top of the tower. I saw through a courner that the rat was indeed killed, but not by an explosion. We mourned his death for a while, and one of the officers of equivalent rank to mine took control, and decided to stop the tour. I told him repetitevly to bring me to my hometown because we were close to it, but he wouldn't listen.</DreamSpaceship.stages.0.description>
  

  <DreamHeroicDefence.stages.0.label>{0_gender ? Śniłem : Śniłam} o heroic defence</DreamHeroicDefence.stages.0.label>
  <DreamHeroicDefence.stages.0.description>I had to defend our colony against waves and waves of upcoming serpent-like monsters while also sending units to enable some form of passage. It took place on a fiery planet, lots of lava, lots of fire and the sky was red. It goes on for quite a while but in the end units manage to open the passage. I board a shuttle and head towards strange gate which allows for connection of our world to abyss. While trying to do that I meet my friend who was apparently trapped on this shuttle. I free him and go close the gate. I succeed. Everyone is cheering, calling me a hero, we have a party and I can recognize most of my friends, old friends who I have lost contact with long ago. Everyone is dancing, music is playing and I get to dance with someone I love... </DreamHeroicDefence.stages.0.description>

  <DreamValhalla.stages.0.label>{0_gender ? Śniłem : Śniłam} o meeting ancient god</DreamValhalla.stages.0.label>
  <DreamValhalla.stages.0.description>I was sitting on a grassy hill surrounded by mountains full of trees and green white grass. After a while, tall old man with round hat and staff approached me. There were two crows sitting on the staff. He said "look" and pointed to the horizon and then a old viking came up right next to me leaning on a tree with a battered shield and said to me "Grunts would be pigs if they knew what the old boar was suffering". Out of nowhere trees and hills are on fire. The old man looked at me and said "Valhalla is coming for you. Don't forget me."</DreamValhalla.stages.0.description>

  <DreamAnimalCompetition.stages.0.label>{0_gender ? Śniłem : Śniłam} o animal competition</DreamAnimalCompetition.stages.0.label>
  <DreamAnimalCompetition.stages.0.description>I joined a dog-sledding competition, which was a racetrack where the dogs ski around a track for several laps. I cheated by putting on my dog's uniform and entering the race as my dog (and giving my dog my clothes so he can look like me cheering him on). I went through the whole race, skiing stiffly to look like a dog skiing, but at the very end I felt guilty about cheating and bumped into a pole so I'd get second place. 7' tall Bruce Willis knew that I cheated and got back at me by standing very close to me and making me look short.</DreamAnimalCompetition.stages.0.description>
       
  <DreamAliensFight.stages.0.label>{0_gender ? Śniłem : Śniłam} o fighting with aliens</DreamAliensFight.stages.0.label>
  <DreamAliensFight.stages.0.description>I was part of an elite team, defending against the Aliens. I would love to say that my special power was a grappling hook, but alas my mind construed it as gum. The function was the same, anyhow. So there I was, zipping through the city towards one of the crashed ships. When me and my comrade got there, it opened. And I felt the most bone chilling sense of fear. I ran, and my comrades ran away. Then I stopped and instead of being on the run, I slung myself to the highest point nearby, an old construction crane. And I sat. And I watched.</DreamAliensFight.stages.0.description>
     
  <DreamFireTornado.stages.0.label>{0_gender ? Śniłem : Śniłam} o fire tornado</DreamFireTornado.stages.0.label>
  <DreamFireTornado.stages.0.description>I was wandering through a jungle until I noticed a giant fire tornado. It simply stood there, not burning anything - the ground around it was burnt and barren but around it was a lush wild, rain forest. There were some locals worshipping it. They told me that it was The Element and explained the lore of Elementals. Elements are aspects of reality that humanity sees as important and symbolic - they can be as basic as "fire" or as complicated as "chaos" or "jealousy". They are simultaneously Gods, Worlds and Hive Minds of living beings - smaller elementals that might think that they act of free will. But elementals are not free - they act as the Element as a whole wills them. This tornado of fire is a high level Elemental and it needs constant worship which the locals do in shifts. If they stop, it will spread fire all around and feed on our fear of it.</DreamFireTornado.stages.0.description>

  <AnimalForestDream.stages.0.description>I was a small animal (I think it was a raccoon?) in a random windy forest. It was pretty nice even if all I did was wander around and occasionally see other creatures, and at some point I think I befriended a groundhog. I'm not too sure on how it ended but the last thing I vaguely remember was seeing buildings over a hill. ~~okoyum</AnimalForestDream.stages.0.description>
