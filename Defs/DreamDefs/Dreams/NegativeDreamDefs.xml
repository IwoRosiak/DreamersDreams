        <label>Dreamt about dark figures</label>
        <description>I was wandering around the colony when I saw a shadowy figure coming out of a dark corner. I asked it what it wants, but it didn't respond. The figure approached me, coming closer and closer with each second. I panicked, the fear paralysed me. Then another figure appeared behind me. After that, the figures grabbed me by my legs and arms. I screamed and everything went dark.</description>

        <description>I awoke in my room <!--Can we replace this with the pawn's sleeping place? (Barracks/Bedroom?)-->. Felt a bit thirsty so I went to the kitchen to drink some water. Went outside to get some fresh air and there was an enormous moon up in the sky. Everything was shaking, almost like an earthquake was terrorizing the area. Orange light illuminated the surroundings. Buildings were floating here and there, like gravity had been turned off. The Moon came closer. The shaking got stronger. I heard screaming. Then some odd force hit me and I collapsed.</description>

        <description>Me and my best friend <!--Can we reference them?--> met in front of their house. We wanted to go biking together, and so we did. We were biking around many different places. When we were finally coming back home we saw a bunch of alligators climbing on a fence next to us. Scared, we rode away as fast as we could. After some time it got really cold outside, so we stopped under someone's house so we could dress up into heavier clothes. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a tank appeared and shot at us. My friend escaped with their bike, leaving me alone. Sometime later I woke up at a house. It was the same house we stopped at to dress up. An old man was the owner and he was actually nice. My phone's battery was completely dead though. I wanted to go back home with my bike, but it was in pieces and some were missing. I walked home to tell my parents what happened. When I came back for my bike my other friends were taking it apart for parts. I had to fight them for my bike.</description>

        <description>I was in a small church, getting married. My family was sitting on one side of the room, and the other side was where my fiance's family was. The pastor was giving the ceremony, and we were holding hands, looking at each other. At one point, I slowly looked over to both our families. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Everything was fine. My family was sitting in the pews, as normal, my fiance's as well. After looking at them, I looked at my fiance. A few seconds later, I looked back at the families, and noticed something odd. My fiance's family had changed into a random menagerie of canines. My family was completely unphased. I look back at my fiance which had turned into a greyish black werewolf, smirking, still holding my hands.</description>

        <description>I was a teenager in a town of ZakÄ…tek. My father was an owner of a japanese-style inn, built many years ago by a man who was obsessed with Japan. It was summer and the usual fog rolled in - the fog that made all of our powers stronger. My power of reinforcement magic helped in many incidents around town. Many youths go wild with their boosted powers so fights, petty theft or even small fires are to be expected. But this time, people were disappearing. Specifically, people who stayed at our inn. Strangers. We don't use magic on strangers. We try to hide it from strangers. But someone was kidnapping them. And we found the corpses. Mutilated except for their faces. Then not just the strangers went missing. Our girls too. All of them pretty. Their faces still preserved in their beauty when they were found.</description>

As I walked up to the hill overlooking the colony <!--Can we put in the (dynamic) name of the colony here?-->, I started to calm. As I reached the top, I sat down upon the grass under the trees and watched calmly as a small figure fell down from the boundless, blue sky. Only then, as the antigrain warhead went off did I understand why I had felt that urgency.</description>

He wanted to join us, along with his giant boomalope. After a long discussion, he was refused, but he still insisted on passing through the colony. He led the boomalope through our fields and when he was in the middle of our crops, near the windmills... he released the 'lope and ran like hell. Then came the bandits. He was part of the bandits... and the boomalope exploding was the sign for the attack.</description>

        <label>Dreamt about redhead with beard</label>
        <description>It started off at school, where I began to realize something was wrong. Everyone I saw looked like they could barely contain themselves from instantly becoming violent, and they had this look in their eyes like they had just spotted the best prey they had ever seen, but were held back by something. I remember thinking "No way, I'm out", and ran home as fast as I could. Some of it is blurry, but I remember coming across people that I knew, either friends or family, or people from the neighborhood, telling me to get home, that it's not safe. Finally I make it there, put the key in the front door, open it, and I am literally surrounded by all of those same people, only now they look like the ones at school, and there stands the redhead with the beard. Without saying a word she lunges at me and pierces my neck with her fangs. </description>
