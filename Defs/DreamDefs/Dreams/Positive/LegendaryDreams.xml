        <description>Everything was to my command. Mountains and oceans, birds and fish, good people and bad people... Yet, I did not want to disturb that chaos. I watched and laughed.</description>

        <label>Dreamt about meeting ancient god</label>
        <description>I was sitting on a grassy hill surrounded by mountains full of trees and green white grass. After a while, tall old man with round hat and staff approached me. There were two crows sitting on the staff. He said "look" and pointed to the horizon and then a old viking came up right next to me leaning on a tree with a battered shield and said to me "Grunts would be pigs if they knew what the old boar was suffering". Out of nowhere trees and hills are on fire. The old man looked at me and said "Valhalla is coming for you. Don't forget me."</description>
