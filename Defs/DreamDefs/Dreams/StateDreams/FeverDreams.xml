        <description>There was an unseen creature in my bed with me, gnawing on my limbs. It seemed to enjoy itself, nibbling on every bone with endless patience. I did not feel pain, but I could hear the crunching and tearing of my body. Eventually, it ate all of me, and I was gone.</description>

        <description>I was lying, cramped, in a small metal box with a big window. Something clicked and whirred, and the lights came on. It got hotter and hotter, and I realized I was lying in an oven! The heat rose and rose, until I woke up.</description>
