      <label>Dreamt about redhead with beard</label>
      <description>It started off at school, where I began to realize something was wrong. Everyone I saw looked like they could barely contain themselves from instantly becoming violent, and they had this look in their eye like they had just spotted the best prey they had ever seen, but were being held back by something. I remember thinking "No way, I'm out", and ran home as fast as I could. Some of it is blurry, but I remember coming across people that I knew, either friends or family, or people from the neighborhood, telling me to get home, that it's not safe. Finally I make it there, put the key in the front door, open it, and I am literally surrounded by all of those same people, only now they look like the one's at school, and there stands the redhead with the beard. Without saying a word she lunges at me and out came the fangs right into my neck. ~Rinzler0001</description>
