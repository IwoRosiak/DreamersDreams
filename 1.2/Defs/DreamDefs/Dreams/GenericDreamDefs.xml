    <label>Dreamt about tourist spaceship</label>
    <description>I was on a huge, cubical spaceship. The command center was located in a tower in the middle of the ship, deep within instead of the outer shell of the craft. The weirdest thing was that the ship captain was a 3 feet tall rat in the same white uniform I was wearing, too. Everyone respected him. One time, a canadian hockey player in his hockey uniform with the helmet on decided to visit our ship. We welcomed him aboard, and everyone was happy. While we were walking alongside the football field, we saw a tank, and the rat was controlling it. Our rat captain pointed the tank's barrel towards the hockey player, and I had to run in front of the hockey player for it to cease fire and not shoot the hockey player. The tank stopped, and then started driving away. As it started moving backwards, we were cheering. I showed the hockey player inside the ship, where there was a ton of supermarket-like shops, one of them was hanging on the ropes. After that in some time I lost the hockey player, but then he came back, thanked me for my service and left. After a while we got news that the captain was killed in an explosion. I rushed to the top of the tower with the command center, and I entered a luxury apartment at the very top. I saw through a corner that the rat was indeed killed, but not by an explosion. We mourned his death for a while, and one of the officers of equivalent rank to mine took control, and decided to stop the tour. I told him repetitevly to bring me to my colony because we were close to it, but he wouldn't listen.</description>

    <description>I was sitting on a grassy hill surrounded by mountains full of trees and green white grass. After a while, a tall old man with round hat and staff approached me. There were two crows sitting on the staff. He said "look" and pointed to the horizon and then an old viking came up right next to me leaning on a tree with a battered shield and said to me "Grunts would be pigs if they knew what the old boar was suffering". Out of nowhere the trees and hills were set on fire. The old man looked at me and said "Valhalla is coming for you. Don't forget me."</description>

    <description>I was a hitman protecting a young person from signing a bad contract with a bad organization. When I mean young, I mean he was about 10. It was midnight, and there was a school on an Urbworld under a tall skyscraper. The boy just finished his music class, so I when followed him and told him about my mission, he turned away. Then he entered a two-floored transport shuttle that was connected with the second floor of the school. The shuttle was black and seemed luxurious. The boy sat down on a purple couch, and a man came to him, guarded by men dressed in black. The man gave the boy a contract to sign, and then I knew he was my target to assasinate, so I shot him and escaped. The other men chased me.</description>

    <label>Dreamt about a space ship</label>
    <description>I woke up on a space ship. We were all supposed to be in cryo, but as we slept, someone was preforming nasty experiments on the rest of us. It happened when my pod was breached by some horror intent on eating me. I barehanded beat up and choked it to death as it licked me with seething tentacles spilling out its mouth in a last ditch effort to make me turn away in disgust. As I looked around I saw my comrades in various states of alien transformation, I immediately recalled we were headed to "New Earth," on a colony ship. I found a futuristic axetool powered by some uranium crystal; a rotator caused the blade on the head to spin fast enough to turn into some kinda plasma that enabled me to cut into sealed chambers. The ship itself was made of some rusty brown metal, the floors were completely covered in blood and weird molds pulsated from half-eaten pools of human. I was completely naked and had slipped and slid on various occasions as I cleared the ship looking for survivors.</description>

    <description>I joined a dog-sledding competition, which was a racetrack where the dogs ski around a track for several laps. I cheated by putting on my dog's uniform and entering the race as my dog (and giving my dog my clothes so he can look like me cheering him on). I went through the whole race, skiing stiffly to look like a dog skiing, but at the very end I felt guilty about cheating and bumped into a pole so I'd get second place. The 7' tall Stellarch knew that I cheated and got back at me by standing very close to me and making me look short.</description>

    <description>I was part of an elite team, defending against the Aliens. I would love to say that my special power was a grappling hook, but alas my mind construed it as gum. The function was the same, anyhow. So there I was, zipping through the city towards one of the crashed ships. When me and my comrade got there, it opened. And I felt the most bone chilling sense of fear. I ran, and my comrades ran away. Then I stopped and instead of being on the run, I slung myself to the highest point nearby, an old construction crane. And I sat. And I watched.</description>

    <label>Dreamt about fire tornado</label>
    <description>I was wandering through a jungle until I noticed a giant fire tornado. It simply stood there, not burning anything - the ground around it was burnt and barren but around it was a lush wild, rain forest. There were some locals worshipping it. They told me that it was The Element and explained the lore of Elementals. Elements are aspects of reality that humanity sees as important and symbolic - they can be as basic as "fire" or as complicated as "chaos" or "jealousy". They are simultaneously Gods, Worlds and Hive Minds of living beings - smaller elementals that might think that they act of free will. But elementals are not free - they act as the Element as a whole wills them. This tornado of fire is a high level Elemental and it needs constant worship which the locals do in shifts. If they stop, it will spread fire all around and feed on our fear of it.</description>

When we were finally coming back home we saw a bunch of alligators climbing on a fence next to us. Scared, we rode away as fast as we could. After some time it got really cold outside, so we stopped under someone's house so we could dress up into heavier clothes. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a tank appeared and shot at us. My friend escaped with their bike, leaving me alone. Sometime later I woke up at a house. It was the same house we stopped at to dress up. An old man was the owner and he was actually nice. My phone's battery was completely dead though. I wanted to go back home with my bike, but it was in pieces and some were missing. I walked home to tell my parents what happened. When I came back for my bike my other friends were taking it apart for parts. I had to fight them for my bike.</description>

My family was sitting in the pews, as normal, my fiance's as well. After looking at them, I looked at my fiance. A few seconds later, I looked back at the families, and noticed something odd. My fiance's family had changed into a random menagerie of canines. My family was completely unphased.

    <label>Dreamt about abandoned maze</label>
    <description>I wandered around a labyrinth of rooms and hallways made up of my childhood home and locations I had previously visited, like my school and my friend's and family's houses. Everything was in black and white, and I had the feeling of being followed, or even chased at times. The rooms always looked run down, like they had been abandoned...</description>

    <description>I was walking away from the colony. I  felt a strong sense of urgency, that I needed to get away, yet I couldn't figure out why. As I walked up to the hill overlooking the colony , I started to calm. As I reached the top, I sat down upon the grass under the trees and watched calmly as a small figure fell down from the boundless, blue sky. Only then, as the antigrain warhead went off did I understand why I had felt that urgency.</description>

    <description>A cowboy called us on the radio. The entire colony gathered to chat with him. Half were charmed by his outlandish tales, half felt he was sketchy. He wanted to join us, along with his giant boomalope. After a long discussion, he was refused, but he still insisted on passing through the colony. He led the boomalope through our fields and when he was in the middle of our crops, near the windmills... he released the 'lope and ran like hell. Then came the bandits. He was part of the bandits... and the boomalope exploding was the sign for the attack.</description>
