      <label>Dreamt about redhead with beard</label>
      <description>It started off at school, where I began to realize something was wrong. Everyone I saw looked like they could barely contain themselves from instantly becoming violent, and they had this look in their eyes like they had just spotted the best prey they had ever seen, but were held back by something. I remember thinking "No way, I'm out", and ran home as fast as I could. Some of it is blurry, but I remember coming across people that I knew, either friends or family, or people from the neighborhood, telling me to get home, that it's not safe. Finally I make it there, put the key in the front door, open it, and I am literally surrounded by all of those same people, only now they look like the ones at school, and there stands the redhead with the beard. Without saying a word she lunges at me and pierces my neck with her fangs. ~Rinzler0001</description>

      <description>I way lying on a huge pile of human corpses, some rotten, some fresh. I couldn't move. It was some kind of cargo section inside of a ship in the sea. From the pile crawled a rotten corpse and he grabbed my feet and bit off some toes. He crawled closer and tried to bite... well... that place... I woke up with pain in that place... ~Backrevol</description>

      <label>Dreamt about moon armageddon</label>
      <description>I awoke in my room. Felt a bit thirsty so I went to the kitchen to drink some water. Opened a window to let some fresh air in and there was an enormous moon, everything was shaking, almost like an earthquake was terrorizing the area. Orange light iluminated the surroundings. Buildings were floating here and there, like gravity never existed. The Moon was getting closer. The shaking got stronger. I heard some screams. Then some odd force hit me and I colapsed. ~Backrevol</description>

      <description>I was a small animal (I think it was a raccoon?) in a random windy forest. It was pretty nice even if all I did was wander around and occasionally see other creatures, and at some point I think I befriended a groundhog. I'm not too sure on how it ended but the last thing I vaguely remember was seeing buildings over a hill. ~~okoyum</description>
